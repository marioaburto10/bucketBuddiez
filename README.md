# :earth_americas: Bucket Buddiez! :smile:


## Overview
A web app that allows users to input places they would like to travel to, and then match with mutual friends who also want to go there!

Log in with your FaceBook account and then click on places you want to travel to in your lifetime. Clicking on these locations will add them to your bucket list. When veiwing your bucket list, click on a location to see if you have any mutual friends who also want to go there. If you do, then start arranging some travel plans! :airplane:

Please try out the deployed app in Heroku, found [here](https://bucket-buddiez.herokuapp.com/).


## Functionality
On the Front End, the app uses `Materialize`, `jQuery`, `AJAX`, and the HTML is rendered using `Handlebars`.

On the Back End, the app uses `Node.js` and `MySQL`. The Node Packages used in the app are `Sequelize` as a SQL ORM, `Express` for serving and routing, `Passport` for User Authenication, and `bcrypt-nodejs` for hashing user passwords.

For persistant data, the app uses 4 MySQL tables to store `Users` and places where users want to visit (`Cities`, `States`, and `Countries`). All users are then linked to the places they want to visit in the `City-Like`, `State-Likes`, and `Country-Likes` tables, which are generated by the Sequelize ORM.


## Cloning down the repo
If you wish to clone the app down to your local machine...

1. Use MySQL Workbench to create a database called `bucketBuddiezDB`:
  * The raw SQL query is `CREATE DATABASE bucketBuddiezDB;`.
2. Inside the `config` folder, open up the `config.json` file:
  * In the `development` object, add your MySQL localhost `password`.
3. In your terminal, `cd` into the project folder and run:
  * `npm install` to download all node.js dependencies
  * `npm run setupDB` to migrate/seed the database
4. Finally, you can run the programming using:
  * `node server.js` in the terminal to start the node server
  * And navigating to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Bucketlist Page (`/view/bucketlist` route)
![bucketlist](/screenshots/bucketlist.png)
#### After a sucessful login, the user is redirect to their bucketlist.
#### Using a session in `Passport-js` and `Handlebars-js` templating, this page is unqiue to each user.
#### If locations were added to the users accounts, they will be seen here. 
#### Clicking a (-) icon removes them from the list using an `AJAX` call to our `API` endpoints.
#### From this page, the user can also Log Out of their account and end the session.


### Note that clicking "Find Travel Buddy" on the Bucketlist Page opens a `materialize` modal.

#### If there are other users who also wish to travel to the location, their email addresses and names will be shown.

#### Conversely, if our `sequelize-js` query finds no other users related with said place, a different message appears.
